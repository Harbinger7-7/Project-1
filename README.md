# Project-1
this consists of the code for the projects geriatrics using IoT data
the goal of this project is to utilise IoT generated data to predict the risk levels of Oxygen saturation, Blood pressure and sugar levels
as the dataset is synthetically generated (but mimics real world data), it is of low volume and model used is randomforest classifier
the model code is to be run first as it is responsible for the training of the model
the app code is the final code that is used to predict the results
